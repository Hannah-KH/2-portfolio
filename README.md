The purpose behind this project was to create a portfolio page using the skills I've learnt to date in HTML and CSS. Some particular features include:
- menu links jump to the relevant section
- labels are overlaid on top of images
- my profile picture links to LinkedIn
- my 2 projects link to the deployed applications
- all links open in a new tab
- the design is responsive
